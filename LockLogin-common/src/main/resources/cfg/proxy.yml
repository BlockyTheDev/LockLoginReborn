#the proxy instances! You can write here
#whatever you want. BUT MUST BE THE SAME

#Karma remote messaging protocol info.
#The address is the IP address in where this
#server remote messaging will be hosted, and the port
#is the port that will listen for new connections.
#
#By default, there are no extra steps while all servers are running locally
#but if your bungee server is out of your network, for example, in another VPS
#which is not the same as your spigot servers, then you should CHANGE and
#OPEN the port for TCP, and also change the Address to the local IPv4 address
Channel:
  Address: "127.0.0.1"
  Port: 49305

#Manage which servers will use LockLogin
# This works like server-priority of bungee's configuration,
# the plugin will try with the first, if fail with the second
# and like that until the list ends or the player-server-send is success.
#
# To use all the servers you can use '*' or add all of them manually
Servers:
  Lobby:
    - "lobby"
