#As of LockLogin 1.13.15, LockLogin opens server owners
#the ability to send data between servers using RemoteMessaging
#API also made by LockLogin owner. This option is not really recommended
#unless you think you really need it. IT MAY BE ALSO NEEDED BY SOME MODULES
#TO ENABLE MODULE COMMUNICATION
#
# Please note, this option is only needed if you really want to make this server also be a RemoteMessaging server.
# When is this recommended? Actually, never, but if some module requires it, there's the option
#
# Enabled -> Enables/Disabled this server RemoteMessaging server
# Address -> Should be 127.0.0.1 for only local network, or your IPv4 address for public access network
# Port -> The port where the server will be listening ( must be open for public access network )
# Key -> Can't be empty, is the key needed to access the RemoteMessaging channel, this way only clients
#        with the password can access the channel
Server:
  Enabled: false
  Address: '127.0.0.1'
  Port: 49305

#
# Please note, this option requires you to open ports if your bungeecord or velocity server is not on the same
# network as this server. Also, please note that RemoteMessaging uses TCP to transfer messages, which sometimes can be slow
#
# '<ip>' -> Must be the BungeeCord/Velocity server address, leave default if it's on the same machine
# Port -> Must be the BungeeCord/Velocity RemoteMessaging channel port, THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS BungeeCord or Velocity
#         game port. By default, RemoteMessaging uses port 49305
# Local -> Is the port which the client will use to connect to the remote messaging, by default RemoteMessaging uses 49300,
#          but in case this port is used by other process, you can change it to any free port.
# Password -> It's the server password
Connection:
  Servers:

#The channel mode
#
# DISABLED -> Do not use RemoteMessaging channel
# MODULE_ONLY -> Use it only for modules
# EVERYTHING -> Use it for the plugin and modules
Mode: DISABLED
